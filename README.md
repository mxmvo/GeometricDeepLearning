# Goal

For my thesis I will need some code, these files are implementations of algorithms that are necessary for the preproccessing step, and eventually the reproduction of the result that I will find. 

This is still work in progress, code will likely to be changed, hopefully for the better. 

See the examples directory for some examples.

# Thesis

My thesis will be in the area of geometric deep learning. More information will follow.
