    "In this post I will exhibit two way of approximate geodesics between two points. A linear way and a 2nd order approximation. <br/>\n",
    "**Important:** this method is only as good as it's distance function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both these methods requires a distance function, the distance function will be calculated in two different ways, namely the heat method is used as described in [Geodesics in Heat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/HeatMethod/), and the Fast Marching Method as described in [Computing geodesic paths on manifolds](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.95.15.8431).  Geodesics can then be computed using gradient descent. The method does not require a distance function over the entire manifold, in case we only want to find small geodesics. In the linear case the gradient is constant on each triangle, the path is then constructed by finding interections with the edge. A bit more details below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second order approximation, there is a constant transition between the manifold and charts. These charts are 2 dimensional representation of a vertex and its neighbors. In this flat space we find a second order approximation of the distance function, the computed 2 dimensional points are then translated back to the manifold. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the linear case points are only computed on the edges of faces, while in the second order the path also consists of points on the faces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of these charts and the translation between the charts and the manifold are done in the `trimesh` object. This object consists of additional attributes and functions that could be usefull.\n",

The Fast Marching seems to give a more accurate account, there seems to be a symmetry in the $z$-plance. The heat method is missing this. Granted we are querring a point close to the cut locus.
